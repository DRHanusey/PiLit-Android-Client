See PiLit-Android-Client1 for updated version

# PiLit-Android-Client
Android client app that allwos for control of LED light strips and the creation of custom light configurations.

This is an ongoing school project. It is a bit on the sloppy side and an emphasis has been placed on feature completion
over best-practice coding. There are many bugs at the time of this upload. This project was downloaded from my team's
private Github organization and re-uploaded here for demonstration purposes. We could not figure out how to make our 
organization repos public.

I will update this repo after the project deadline in 3 weeks. Hopefully that version will be much easier to read
and will be more efficient.
